```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
source("CleanData.R")
```

I think in your summary of UFO shapes, you probably wanted something like this?

```{r}
ufo_data %>%
  group_by(UFO_shape) %>%
  summarize(ufo_shape_total = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(ufo_shape_total)) %>%
  head(15)
```

Or maybe not.  You do later use the number by shape for other analysis.
